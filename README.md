# Asynchronous Local-SGD Training for Language Modeling
This repository contains a Colab notebook that presents a minimal toy example replicating the observed optimization challenge in asynchronous Local-SGD.
The task is to perform classification on a mixture of mixtures of Gaussian data.

## Usage

We recommend executing the notebook using a PyTorch GPU kernel.
